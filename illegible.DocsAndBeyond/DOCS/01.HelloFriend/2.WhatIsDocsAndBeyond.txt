as you can see 

i made a class library for docs and beyond 

the first reson is to show how much document is importent to me

but the main reson it's beyond documents!

//ok i love playing with words i khow

so what's that mean at all?

let me clear:
1.docs ==> when i use this word i mean text's,pics,diagrams, and more

2.beyond ==> i mean object's like classes , interfaces and more objects
 related to each other ;
 this object's show's broken way's ,broken pattern's
 anti pattern's  in  my mistake's side;
 
 and also show's my own created ways that i love
 and my suggestions and my issues 
 and my diffrent way's to do the same work 
 and more and more and more like that

 //it's just for learning more and more
 
 im gonna categorize all this doc's and beyond to easy access
 // just see next docs to start talk to me
