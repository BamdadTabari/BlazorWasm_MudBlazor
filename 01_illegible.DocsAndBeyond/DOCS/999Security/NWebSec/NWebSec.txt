an important concern's in website security is http request's

with https (god bless Tls) many of vulnerabilities of http is Resolved

but ! there is no 100 percent security in based of goddes "Zero Trust" Concept.

ok , the main subject is nwebSec library 

an open source security library for .net 

using this library in .net Core is easier as you think 

for example configurations go to path mentioned blew in project
